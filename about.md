## About Me

My name is **Javidan Hasanli**, and I am a student at **ADA University** studying **Electronic and Electrical Engineering**.

I am interested in electronics, electrical systems, and understanding how hardware and software components work together in modern technological systems. My academic background has helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and a solid foundation in engineering principles.

This personal website was created as part of the **SITE1101 – Principles of Information Systems** course to present my background, projects, and academic development.
