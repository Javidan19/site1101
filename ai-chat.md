# AI Assistance Log – SITE1101 Project

Limited assistance from AI (ChatGPT) was used during the development of this project.

The AI was consulted only for specific technical and challenging aspects, including:
- Clarifying unclear or complex assignment requirements
- Understanding correct HTML structure and basic CSS usage
- Resolving selected issues related to GitHub Pages and Jekyll configuration
- Receiving guidance on implementing light/dark mode functionality
- Adding a simple opening animation effect for better user experience

The main structure, content, design decisions, and implementation of the website
were completed independently by the student. AI was used strictly as a supportive
tool for difficult parts rather than for generating the full project.
