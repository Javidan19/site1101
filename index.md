## Hello, I’m Javidan Hasanli 👋

I am a student at ADA University studying Information Technologies.  
This website is my personal portfolio created for the **SITE1101 – Principles of Information Systems** course.

Here you can find:
- information about my background and skills,
- the projects I have worked on during my studies,
- and links to my academic and technical profiles.

This website is built using **Jekyll (Minimal Mistakes theme)** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.
